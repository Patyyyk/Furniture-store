# Furniture-store Coders Lab final project
This is my first project on React. I still working on it. 
## Things to do:
- Search engine of products
- Live version
- Product site
- Categories of furnitures
- Adding products to basket
- Login and registration
- CSS and styling
## Installation
For now you need to install json server to load an API with products 

```https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server```

And run db.json
